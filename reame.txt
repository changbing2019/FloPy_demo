The 8 notebooks were used to extract the output files of the MODFLOW models with mf2005.
The notebooks need to have FloPy module installed.
The file paths are absolute paths. If you want to implement them on you computers, you need to change those file paths.
 


See the following file paths

#Set the paths
loadpth = 'D://USGS_UA//scenario_models//8//mf2005'
filehds=r'D:\USGS_UA\scenario_models\8\mf2005\eaa_pred.hds'
cbdf=r'D:\USGS_UA\scenario_models\8\mf2005\eaa_pred.cbd'
fcsv=r'D:\USGS_UA\scenario_models\8\SR8_results_at_the targets.csv'
Realization='Scenario Realization 8'

The two csv files are from USGS file folders
D:\USGS_UA\working\_data\head_obs.crd.csv'
r'D:\USGS_UA\working\_data\DRN_dict.csv'

The following files are from the bottom-up archive folders by Jim
D:\Bottom-Up Archive\Bottom-Up Model Runs\L4STG5_MarcTrigger_newASRSchedule_AddVISPO_for30cfs\target_head.xlsx
D:\Bottom-Up Archive\Bottom-Up Model Runs\L4STG5_MarcTrigger_newASRSchedule_AddVISPO_for30cfs\target_flux.xlsx
